# Customer Segmentation Optimization & Delivery Standerdization for Swire Coca-Cola
## Project Overview
### Swire Coca-Cola’s distribution team found that an outdated 400-gallon/year rule for customer segmentation was leading to inefficiencies in its delivery model. Lower-volume customers were being serviced with costly in-house Red Truck deliveries instead of third-party White Truck service, causing significant waste. This static threshold failed to adapt to actual customer behavior, resulting in:
Missed revenue opportunities: An estimated $52–$74 million in annual revenue was being forfeited due to suboptimal customer classification​

Operational inefficiencies: Many low-volume customers remained in high-cost delivery groups (Red Trucks), inflating logistics costs​

Customer misclassification: The rigid rule overlooked some potentially high-volume customers who were not properly identified under the old system​
